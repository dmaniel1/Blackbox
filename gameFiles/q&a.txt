Q: Why am I here?
A: To test the terminal, of course!

Q: When can I leave?
A: After we feel you are done testing.

Q: Can I leave now?
A: No.

Q: Who am I?
A: You.

Q: Why can't I remember anything?
A: After signup, we have to inject you with a memory-erasing compound in order to make sure you do not remember anything after testing (as seen on 14.5c in the waiver you signed upon entry). 
   An unwanted side effect is total amnesia. It's temporary though!
